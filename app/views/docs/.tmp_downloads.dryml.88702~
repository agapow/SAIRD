		Some of the tools accept spreadsheets as a way to upload large amounts
		of data in one go. This page describes the format used by those
		spreadsheets.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Bulk upload of susceptibility reports</h3>
	
	<p>
		An example of the spreadsheet can be found
		<a href="#{base_url/downloads/upload-suscep-reports.xls}">here</a>,
		containing a few example rows. These rows can be deleted and
		your own data included for use.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The spreadsheet format is as follows: it consists of a set of named
		columns. Order is unimportant, but case is. These are:
	</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Isolate name: the name or id of the report</li>
			<li>Collected: the date of sample collection , given in reverse
				international format, e.g. 2010-12-25</li>
			<li>Comment</li>
			<li>Any number of columns named after a resistance, e.g.
				Oseltamivir, Oseltamivir (MUNANA). These should give a number
				or be blank, e.g. 0.1.</li>
			<li>Any number of columns named after a gene, e.g.
				HA, NA. These should give a comma delimited list of
				mutations, e.g. H275P, H274X.</li>
		</ul>
