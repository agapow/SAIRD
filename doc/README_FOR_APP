How to get this running
-----------------------

Make sure you got a compiler and stuff (needed for less)

	% sudo wajig install build-essential
	
Install rvm as per webpage

Install readline, openssl, libxslt under rvm (needed for irb, rails and roo respectively) 

	% rvm pkg install openssl
	% rvm pkg install readline

Install ruby 1.9.2

	% rvm install 1.9.2
	% rvm default 1.9.2

Install the 2.3.10 version of rails

Check you are using the correct gem and everything.

install rails v2.3.10

	% gem install rails -v '2.3.10'
	
Install Hobo

	% gem install hobo -v '1.0.3'

Install the less gem & plugin for rails as per this page

	https://github.com/cloudhead/more/

Install Roo

Follow the instruction for installing paperclip and paperclip_with_hobo from
this webpage

	http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/plugins/paperclip_with_hobo

Dowbngrade to Rubygems 1.6.2

Install bluecloth, for some crazy reason Hobo needs it

install sqlite3 if your using that as the db


Install Paperclip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SAIRD using the paperclip library for handling file uploads. This requires the
installation of the library itself and the hobo plugin for the library. 

TODO: do we have the versions right?

% gen install paperclip

./script/plugin install git://github.com/tablatom/paperclip_with_hobo.git
