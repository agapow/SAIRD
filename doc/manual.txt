SAIRD Manual and How-To
=======================

Introduction
------------

Emerging drug resistance is a urgent problem in public health. In many common
diseases like influenza and tuberculosis, it is critical to record and share
resistance data so as to prepare interventions and appropriate clinical
treatments. SAIRD - the South American Influenza Resistance Database - is a
web-based system for tracking and comparing resistance data across a number of
reporting regions, allowing the saving and searching of resistance trends.


The SAIRD model & concepts
--------------------------

How SAIRD works, in a paragraph: *Members* will enter and view *susceptibility
reports* for specific *countries*, *seasons* and *virus types*. These can be
compared against *thresholds* (which are also specific for particular
countries, seasons and virus types). Special *tools* are available to for
complicated searching, comparison and graphing of the data.

In more detail:

* A *country* is given geographical area or reporting region, with
  associated members.

* A *season* is a year-long period, that starts on a given day and continues
  until that day on the following year. 
  
* Users of SAIRD are grouped into several categories:

	* *Members* are associated with countries and cannot see data for other
	  countries:
	
		* *Readers*: can only see data for their country, but not add to or edit
		  it.
	
		* *Editors*: normal members, can add to or edit the data associated with
		  a country.

	* *Administrators*: special privileged users, can create, edit or
	  delete everything.

* The central records stored are *susceptibility reports*. These report
  an instance of observed resistance in a given *season* and *country*. This
  is recorded as a measure of resistance against one or more *drugs*,
  *sequence data* with *mutations* and *patient* information. 

* Susceptibility reports are usefully compared to *seasonal thresholds*. These
  give minor and major limits for a given drug resistance found in a virus
  type in a season and country. 


Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Subsections within the SAIRD site are given either as the name of the section
or as the relative url from the base of the site. For example:

	*Trials*
	``/trials/new``

Where a sequence of menus or choices must be followed, these are given as a
series of steps in italics. For example:

	``Home > Seasons > Add a season``


For users
---------

How do I join the site?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create an account yourself, but:

* You won't be able to log in until have activated your account by clicking on
  a link received in your email.
  
* Then your account won't be able to do or see anything until an administrator
  associates you with a reporting country and gives you the appropriate
  permissions.

Note that if you have a `Gravatar <http://gravatar.com>`__ for the email
address you use, it will appear next to your name in the system.


How do I browse susceptibility reports & seasonal thresholds?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the toolbar on the top of every page, there are links to these:

	*Susceptibility report*
	*Seasonal thresholds*

Click the appropriate one and you see a list or reports or thresholds. Note
that you normally only see those you have access to, i.e. those for countries
in which you are a member.

Click on any of the listed items to go to the individual reports. Note that
in the report you can click on the linked season, country, virus type or
drug resistance to the detail pages for them.


How do I add a susceptibility report?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the list, or index page for susceptibility reports, click the *New*
button. You'll be presented with a form to fill in, with required and
optional parts:

* A susceptibility report must have an name (usually the isolate involved),
  a country, a virus type and a collection date.

* It may have zero or more susceptibility entries (a drug and a measured
  resistance), a patient (with clinical data), and zero or more sequences
  entries (being a gene and associated mutations). The ``+`` and ``-``
  buttons can be used increase the number of the entries, sequences and
  mutations.

After editing the form click *Save*. (Or *Cancel* to not create a new report.)
If there are no problems, you'll be taken to a page that shows the new report.
If there are any errors, you'll return to the editing page, with the problematic fields highlighted. (Errors could include entering the same
mutation multiple times, forgetting to choose a virus type, entering a
negative resistance value, etc.)

You can create a susceptibility report and later add to or edit it. Go to
the index page for reports, click on the correct record to see it, then
click the *Edit* button. You can change the value that are already there,
add entries and sequences and so on.

**Note:** There's a cosmetic bug here - susceptibility reports can have
a patient (i.e. one), but the form will allow you to create a second one.
However if you try and save the report with 2 or more patients, it will
raise an error.


How do I add a seasonal threshold?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Seasonal thresholds are handled just like susceptibility reports: On the list, or index page for thresholds, click the *New* button. Then fill in:

* A virus type, country and season. 

* Optionally, zero or more resistances - an agent or drug with minor and
  major thresholds for resistance.

Just like susceptibility reports, you can edit and add to a seasonal
threshold later, perhaps as data comes in.


How do I add multiple records?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SAIRD provides *tools* for the bulk uploading of susceptibility reports and
seasonal thresholds using Excel spreadsheets. These can be found under the
*Tools > Bulk upload* link from the toolbar. Also, if you look at *Docs >
Downloads*, you find a description of the expected formats for each. 

For susceptibility reports, select the correct country, season and virus type
on the form, and the spreadsheet of data to be uploaded. (Thus, all records
in a single upload belong to the same country, season and virus type.) 
Should there be any mistakes in the data, these will be reported.



For administrators
------------------

Who can do what?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security, there are different classes of users in SAIRD. They are:

* Users: everyone with an account on SAIRD. Unless they are granted
  permissions, they can do very little.
  
* Administrators: special privileged users,, they can create, edit or
  delete everything.
  
* Members: users that are associated with countries. These will form the bulk
  of users, people who can see and create data for that country. Ordinarily
  members cannot see data that is not associated with their country.
  However, a user can be a member of more than one country. Members come in
  three types:
  
	* Editors: are members that are allowed to create and delete data for their
	  country.
	  
	* Readers: are members that can only see data for their country, but not
	  add to or edit it.
	  
	* Managers: members with special administrative powers over their country.
	  Note that at the moment managers have only a few small extra abilities
	  over editors.

**Note:** In development/demonstration mode, there's a gray bar across the top of the screen that allows everyone to see everything and change between
accounts. 


How do I create a user?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way is to let users signup themselves. Note that usernames and
email addresses have to be unique throughout the system. After this, you
give to give users the correct permissions:

* Go to the users index page (via the link in *Tools*). Click on the user to
  view it and the *Edit*.

* Check the appropriate box to give them administrator privileges.

* Use the plus and minus buttons to "add" countries and the associated access.


How do I change / edit / create X?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common cases for users are listed above, but just about everything is
editable in SAIRD. You can browse the lists of data by going to the
appropriate url, e.g.:

	``/Thresholds``
	``/Users``
	etc.

Something to keep in mind is that SAIRD stores two types of data:

* Data: i.e., the usual user-entered information that will: thresholds,
  susceptibility reports etc.
  
* Vocabularies: the lists of choices that are used through the system:
  countries, drug resistances, virus types etc. These can only be
  edited by the administrator. These will change rarely if at all (largely
  only when a new drug or pathogen or reporting region is added) and
  should almost never be deleted.

Creation and editing follows the same rules for all content:

* Go to the index page for the content, e.g. *Drugs*, ``/drugs``. Links to all
  of these can be found on the ``Tools`` page.

* Click *New*

* Fill in the form and click *Save*. Correct errors if necessary.

To edit any record, again go to the index page. Click on the individual records and them click *Edit*. Change as required.

**Note:** be very careful about editing vocabulary tables, especially when it
comes to deleting entries. If, for example, you delete a drug entry that
various reports are using, bad things will happen.
